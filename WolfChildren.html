              <p>Hana is a 19-year-old student who falls in love with a "wolf man". Hana gives birth to two children Yuki and Ame, or "Snow and Rain". At first the family quietly lives in city trying to hide their wolf heritage, but certain circumstances force Hana to make the decision to move to a rural town. <br><br>

              Wolf Children is simply lovely. The art is charming, the music is fitting, the characters are wonderful, and the story is heartwarming. Mamoru Hosoda is wonderful, and this film is no exception. This is not an inspirational tale(heh tail) of heroics or glory, it is a story about life and how it whisks you along. Worth mentioning are the two love stories in the movie. They make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.<br></p>

              <h3>Review:</h3>
              <p>One of the nicest things about the movie is that it takes its sweet time. A lot of people use this as a complaint against the movie, but I think it adds to the experience. I enjoyed seeing every detail from the family's life and all of the ups and downs that are presented. In fact, I wish the movie was longer because I wanted to see more of their lives, especially after the movie ended. The story spans thirteen years, so it makes sense that so many details from Yuki's, Ame's, and Hana's lives are shown to us. It makes the characters feel more real because their small struggles are shown along with their major struggles and their high points. It works very well and I wish more movies were willing to sacrifice some pace in exchange for more detail.</p>
