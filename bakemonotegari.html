              <p>From the very first scene, the art direction of Bakemonogatari is mind blowing. Sometimes everything is drawn in a vivid color palate—though this can and does change at a moment’s notice. Other times it uses matte colors with no shadows. It has quick flashes of live-action scenes that appear seemingly at random as well as sketches modeled after Buddhist scrolls. The camera angles are often abnormal with extreme close-ups and jump cuts used expertly to increase the supernatural feel of the story.

All this makes the anime incredibly interesting to just watch, regardless of whether the characters are in an epic fight or a simple, light-hearted conversation. But more importantly, while captivating, it doesn’t distract from the story; it adds to it.<br><br>

The direction does a great job at making the entire show have a supernatural feel. Locations ranging from abandoned crams schools to crumbling shrines take on a whole new perspective when gods, ghosts, and demons populate the world.<br>

But where Bakemonogatari truly succeeds is by taking the normal world and turning it into anything but. Senjogahara, for example, uses school supplies as lethal weapons to the point where even a normal stapler becomes more than a little frightening. In addition, the violence, though rare in the series, is as graphic as it is unexpected—there is rarely any foreshadowing before violent action. Thus for long stretches you are lulled into a sense of complacency and forget these characters are anything but normal.<br></p>

              <h3>Review:</h3>
              <p>I really enjoyed Bakemonogatari. It is visually stunning, has great characters, an excellent story, and a witty humor that few other anime match. That said, when the series starts using sexual harassment of underage girls as fan service (especially in a story where an attempted rape of an underage girl is a serious plot point) the show really falters. Still, as those moments were rather few and far between, I came away from the show really impressed. If you like modern Japanese fantasy or romantic comedies, Bakemonogatari is a must watch.</p>
